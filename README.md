|1/4/2019|Happy New Year to you and to your family. I hope you had some fun time with your family away from Delta. With a clear vision of 2019 Delta’s Goal and Objectives, I am looking forward to the challenges ahead and will work even harder than before. On a positive note, on behalf of myself, please congratulate Mark Liv, our FSM, who needs to be acknowledged for his outstanding leadership skills that mirror yours. For the last several months, I was fortunate enough to get to know Mark either on the phone, simply running into him when I Reported for Work, or via e-mail for technical assistance. I feel he is the best in the base. No matter what situations may be, Mark possesses impressive, accurate knowledge on any subject pertaining to IFS and follows through in a timely manner.  Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for everyone in our base.  Please know that I contact FSMs out of desperation, which is not too often.  He is an outstanding individual who is professional, kind hearted and DEPENDABLE.  What separates Mark from others is that no time spent with any flight attendant takes too long.  You can rest assured that our base is well managed and taken care of while you’re away.  We are fortunate to have someone who is of Mark’s Caliber and I am privileged to know and work with him.|
|12/17/2018|At LGA Sky Club, we used a scheduling system that was time consuming and costly.  The schedule-s were printed and placed in binders in 3 different clubs.  Each time a simple change was made, be it a swap or time correction, a minimum of 10 pages would be reprinted.  As you can imagine, department 127 spent thousands of dollars between ink and paper keeping up with up with this process. We desperately needed a more innovative and efficient process.  In addition to completing his job duties, Mr. Liv went above and beyond and helped us create the LGA SharePoint Site to update this process.  Now that it has been integrated, we will have been able to save thousands of dollars a month on paper, ink and most importantly, the time it takes for each leader to correct and physically bring the copies to each club.  As we know in the industry, every minute counts.  The biggest thank you Mark!  Without him, we wouldn’t have been able to save this much money and time.  Thank you VERY Much!|
|1/9/2017|In my 40 years of service as a flight attendant, I have to say that my current Field Service Manager, Mark Liv, is the best I’ve ever had.  In the short time I have known Mark, he has consistently been available to me.  He quickly returns my calls, promptly assists me with work related issues and is knowledgeable on everything In-Flight related.  He finds the answers.  He always gets back to me even if it means more than one attempt.  Mark deserves to be commended for his dedication to his title as FSM, his professionalism and his unwavering positive attitude.  Mark is a delight to work with and his positive outlook has a great influence on me.  Mark, I appreciate knowing that you always have my back.|
